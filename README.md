# Predicting videogame sales using Bayesian reasoning

## Abstract
*Financial data, such as data representing sales of a certain asset in a given economic sector,
is intrinsically imbued with uncertainty, due to both the uncertainty of the financial market
as well as the noise present in the data itself. In this report, probabilistic reasoning tools are
applied to financial data concerning the sales in the videogames market. First, four different
Bayesian Networks models are constructed either by explicitly defining the structure or by
inferring it from the data. Then, for each model, parameters are learned from the available
data. Finally, inference techniques are applied to perform probabilistic reasoning on the
resulting model.*
